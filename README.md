## 🏁 Getting Started

How donates work, and how it is connected to noebs. Ideally it should describes the workflow and the requirement needed so as to have a in-app purchasing experience, this should be:

- Account creation (webpage in Solus to create a `namespace` account)
- Manual interference? In this step the user must generate a bank account to be linked to the system (it is also called `billerId`)
- Result page:
	- Generic result page (ie. result.soluspay.net, so their customers can get the result)
	- We can host the page in our system (make an api to our dns to generate a new subdomain for them; ahmed-result.soluspay.net)
	- external url
	- and others
    
 ```
 result.soluspay.net/id= & token= & amount =
 ```
